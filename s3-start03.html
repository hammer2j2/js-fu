<h1>Exploring AWS Client Tools - Working with S3</h1>

<h2>Initial Steps with S3</h2>
<p>Currently S3 is already setup for me through the AWS Console GUI.  I recommend this for getting started, and we can return to bucket creation and configuration CLI style a bit later.  If you haven't setup an S3 bucket to use yet, go to the s3 console and click on create: <A href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.</A>  There are other options to add, such as if you want world readable object and permissions inheritance and web serving of your content.  I have turned all of those on.
</p>
<h3>Upload a File to S3 with the AWS CLI</h3>
<p>Now that you have an S3 bucket, let's store something there.  Perhaps an HTML file or other small file you have to start with.  
Mine is called "index.html" since I am starting a web site on S3, that makes sense.<br>
My bucket name is the name of my web site: <em>www.slamgarden.com</em> so I enter the AWS command<br>

<pre>aws s3 cp index.html s3://www.slamgarden.com/</pre>
Now I will upload all my files except my .git and .old directories:
<pre>aws s3 cp . s3://www.slamgarden.com/ --recursive --exclude ".git/*" --exclude ".old/*"</pre>
Note the <em>.git/*</em> part and the <em>*</em> is important or it won't really avoid recursion into the .git directory.
